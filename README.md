# Idle-Pi
One day, your high school math teacher asked you a question: - "Is the π finite or infinite?". Not knowing the answer you created a program that calculates the answer for you.

## Welcome to the world of π!
The program that you created uses these variables:

- *****t***** for the time passed,
- *****π***** for how much digits of π calculated,
- *****d***** for the duration of a calculation of a digit of π,
- *****x***** as how much digits of π calculated every *****d*****,
- *****y***** and *****z***** as methods to increment the digits of π calculated.
